# About:
# I chose Raku as the fourth project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Audio-Editor) as Raku is a lower level (non-application core) language used with Anime Studio. It has a Japanese sounding name, and is in place for Perl-like operations, as Raku is similar to Perl. For the audio editor, it is to be used for macros and low level programming. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
